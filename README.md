## GPS Location Android Studio App (Java) – Basic Description
This Android Studio project demonstrates how to build a simple GPS location app using Java. The app fetches the user's current location using the device's GPS and network providers, displays the latitude and longitude, and can convert coordinates to a human-readable address.

**Key Features**
- Uses Android's standard Location APIs and/or Google Play Services for location tracking.
- Requests runtime permissions for location access (ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION, ACCESS_COARSE_LOCATION).
- Fetches the device’s current latitude and longitude.
- Optionally translates GPS coordinates into a street address using Geocoder.
- Provides a simple UI with a button to get the current location.
- Handles starting and stopping location updates to optimize battery usage.

**Main Components**
- "MainActivity.java": Handles UI and location permission logic. On button click, it retrieves and displays the user’s current location.
- "LocationTrack.java" or similar helper/service class: Encapsulates logic for accessing location providers and fetching location updates.
- "activity_main.xml": Basic layout with a button to trigger location fetch and a TextView to display results.
- Uses `FusedLocationProviderClient` (Google Play Services) or `LocationManager` for compatibility with devices lacking Play Services.
- Utilizes Geocoder for reverse geocoding (coordinates to address).

**Permissions**
Make sure to add the following permissions to your "AndroidManifest.xml":
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION"/>
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.ACCESS_COARSE_LOCATION"/>
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET"/>

**How It Works**
1. The app requests necessary location permissions at runtime for Android 6.0+ devices.
2. When the user presses the "Get Location" button, the app retrieves the current latitude and longitude.
3. The app displays the coordinates and, if implemented, the corresponding address.
4. Location tracking can be started and stopped as needed to save battery.

**Dependencies**
- Java 8+ (Java 11 recommended)
- AndroidX libraries
- Google Play Services (for FusedLocationProviderClient, if used).

**Sample UI**
- A button labeled "Get Location"
- A TextView to display the current latitude, longitude, and optionally the address.

**Typical Use Cases**
- Demonstrating core Android location APIs.
- Learning runtime permission handling.
- Building the foundation for more advanced location-based apps (maps, navigation, etc.).
